You can play the game directly in your browser on our [website](https://eyu.svpj.pl/).  
If you’re interested in how it works, you can also view the full source code on our GitHub repository.

Alternatively, you can run the game locally on your machine using libraries that serve games on localhost.  
To do this, simply download the project archive named `equ.zip`, extract it, and follow the instructions below.

**Download & Install Instructions**

1. **Download**: Get the `equ.zip` file from our website or GitHub releases page.
2. **Extract**: Unzip the file to a folder of your choice.
3. **Serve Locally**:  
   - Make sure you have a static file server installed (for example, [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) for Node.js or Python’s built-in HTTP server).
   - Open a terminal in the extracted folder.
   - Run your chosen server (e.g., `npx http-server .`, `python -m http.server` or `npm run dev`).
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port your server indicates).
4. **Play!** The game should now be available in your browser.

**Requirements**
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- (For local play) Node.js or Python, if using those servers
